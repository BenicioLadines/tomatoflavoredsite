                <p>I was basically the art director on this game. It was a studio project
                    for CCNY's Game Studio class, modeled the player character, along with some of the
                    cubes you mine in the game. You can download and play it from the itch page 
                    <a href="https://pricklyprickle.itch.io/pogo-plunge">here.</a>

                   <p>you can look at my style guide <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16rEB9g4hwlIoIzoBTdVUCELHdypXzVzpyFKgUpH5OCo/edit?usp=sharing">here!</a></p>
