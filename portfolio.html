                <p>I was basically the art director on this game. It was a studio project
                    for CCNY's Game Studio class, modeled the player character, along with some of the
                    cubes you mine in the game. You can download and play it from the itch page 
                    <a href="https://pricklyprickle.itch.io/pogo-plunge">here.</a>

                   <p>I made a style guide for the other artists 
                    on the team to use when they made their assets, you can
                    look at it <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16rEB9g4hwlIoIzoBTdVUCELHdypXzVzpyFKgUpH5OCo/edit?usp=sharing">here!</a></p>

                <p>This is a game I led design on in 2019. It won the Games for Change Student Challenge
                    if that's interesting. I like it, I programmed it when I was 16 and didn't fully understand Object Oriented
                    Programming, or incrementing....... I had some help from my programming teacher, but the levels are 
                    mostly by me with help from Abby. I also did all of the graphics.
